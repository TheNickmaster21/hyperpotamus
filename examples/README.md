This directory contains examples of hyperpotamus scripts with comments explaining what features are included. 

Many of the scripts that I write are for commercial use or are hitting sites that are not of general interest. It is 
actually somewhat challenging to come up with some reasonable and interesting examples that showcase the features of 
hyperpotamus without falling into too much detail. If anyone has suggestions for reasonable examples, or better yet, 
has a hyperpotamus script that you think is worth sharing, I'm happy to accept contributions. :)
