This directory contains examples of hyperpotamus scripts. Many of the scripts that I write are for commercial use
or are hitting sites that are not of general interest. It is actually somewhat challenging to come up with
some reasonable examples that showcase the features of hyperpotamus without falling into too much detail. If anyone
has suggestions for reasonable examples, or better yet, has a hyperpotamus script that you think worth sharing, 
I'm happy to accept contributions. :)
