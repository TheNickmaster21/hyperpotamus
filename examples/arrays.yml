# This script loops through a list of the four gospels and prints them out

# Features used in this script:
# -----------------------------
# Named steps.
# Explictly setting an array value
# using emit and iterate to repeat a set of actions for each element in an array
#   The default behavior for iterate is to repeat the current step, so the step 
#   names and the next: print lines could be removed and it would have the same effect.
